title: It's time to comply with AODA
---

The **Ontarians with Disabilities Act** isn't new, it's been around for a
while now. It was introduced in 2001 and with one objective. Improve the
identification, removal, and prevention of barriers faced by persons with
disabilities and make related amendments  
to other Acts. The Ontario government decided to further elaborate this act in
2005 with the **"Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)"**.
It was groundbreaking legislation and the first of its kind in Canada.

AODA's purpose is to create the accessibility standards that organizations
from public, private, and non-profit sectors must follow and make an
accessible province for all Ontarians.

The standards of the AODA give all people an equal footing as they work, play,
learn, teach, buy, sell, and use their diverse talents to benefit their
communities and their province. The target date was set as January 1, 2025,
for making Ontario inclusive, accessible to people with disabilities.

In 2016, five standards of the AODA are combined under the **Integrated
Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR)**. The standards include Information
and Communications, Employment, Transportation, Design of Public Places, and
Customer Service.

_Note : The **Accessible Canada Act** mandates accessibility standards that
apply to organizations only under federal jurisdiction. The provincial
accessibility laws such as AODA set the standards and guidelines for
organizations within the province._

### Why is Accessibility important?

Accessibility is good for both the economy and the community. Read [more
](https://skthetester.github.io/why-you-cant-skip-accessibility-testing/)about the
different types of disabilities, how the improved standard of living and
population growth resulted in an increase of disabled people and why digital
accessibility is important. Simply put, it is all about inclusiveness, and a
way to ensure that no one is excluded. If your application isnâ€™t accessible,
then you are creating additional barriers for your users with disabilities.

### It's time to comply with AODA

> Businesses and Non-Profits with 20 or more employees, the deadline to meet
> the current accessibility requirements under the Accessibility for Ontarians
> with Disabilities Act (AODA) is June 30, 2021.

Time is already running out for Ontario companies to comply with new standards
to make their websites accessible for people with disabilities. It was
originally set to January 1st, 2021 but the deadline is extended till June
30th, 2021. Failing to comply could result in enforcement including financial
penalties for the following organizations.

  * Businesses or Non-Profits with 20 or more employees
  * Public sector organizations
  * Municipalities
  * Educational Institutions (Colleges, Universities, and Schools)
  * Producers of Educational Material (Textbooks)
  * Library boards

### What does it mean for Digital Accessibility?

The legislation mandates any new or significantly refreshed public websites
for organizations listed in the previous section. The webpage content
including text, images, forms, and sounds should all be accessible and conform
to the **WCAG 2.0 level AA**. Only exceptions to this rule being live captions
and pre-recorded audio descriptions for media.
