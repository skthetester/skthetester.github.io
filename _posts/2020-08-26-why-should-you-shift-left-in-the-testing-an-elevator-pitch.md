title: Why should you shift left testing? An elevator pitch!
---

I was once asked, **“Why do you want to shift left Testing?”**. Back then,
"Shift-Left" wasn't common term or practice as it is today. He was not looking
for a detailed technical explanation, but instead a quick elevator pitch on
why we should do it. The ask was simple, explain to him in under two minutes.
I quickly realized the only way I could do it effectively is by using an
analogy that he understands. So, here is how I did it.

I started off with a simple question.

> Do you love cars?

When he enthusiastically responded,

> Oh, yes!

I shot a series of questions at him.

> What if I told you the car that you just bought was only tested by someone
> taking a test drive before it was delivered to you?
>
> How confident do you feel about your car?
>
> Do you think all the issues in your car have been found, and they had enough
> time to fix it?

If you consider the car as your application, testing the individual parts
would be the unit testing, assembling the parts and testing the systems as a
whole would be the integration tests. Any defects that you find at these
stages are so much easier and cost-efficient to fix than the ones found in the
test drive. That's Shift Left, moving part of the testing from the front-end
GUI layer to further left in the development life cycle, i.e. more of unit,
component and integration testing. He got his answer in two minutes, win-win
for both of us!

What do you think? What would be your explanation if you get the same
question? I would love to hear them. You can leave your comments here or on
