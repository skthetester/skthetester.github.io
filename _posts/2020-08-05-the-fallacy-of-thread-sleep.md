title: The fallacy of Thread.Sleep
---

A simple search in our test automation repository for "Thread.Sleep" returns
over 600 instances in just the baseline regression suite alone. With an
average of 10 seconds per instance, nearly 2 hours of wait time induced by
using Thread.Sleep() alone. By enabling high reuse in the test automation
code, this wait time could inherently be exponentially higher.

While I understand the intent and accept the need for waits in test scripts,
shouldnâ€™t these be replaced with smarter wait handlers such as explicit or
fluent waits? It will definitely reduce the overall execution time.
