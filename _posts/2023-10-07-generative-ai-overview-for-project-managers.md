"Generative AI can lead to Happy Project Managers!" 😇 That’s the exciting message from the newly launched micro-credential course,
'Generative AI Overview for Project Managers' from the Project Management Institute (PMI). Intrigued by the buzz surrounding it in the last few days from my LinkedIn connections, I took this course to explore its potential.

2️⃣ How it can benefit project managers and their teams  
3️⃣ The potential risks and considerations  
4️⃣ Various project management tasks with real-world prompts and AI-driven
responses
