title: What to talk about in your 1:1‚Äôs? (Performance Appraisal)
---

Performance appraisals are tricky. I came across this nice article (#zine)
from [Julia Evans](https://x.com/b0rk) summarizing the list of things
that you would need to discuss in your 1:1's (performance appraisal) to make
it effective. It is a very useful list that you can take along for almost all
your discussions either it be your performance appraisal or weekly checkpoints
with your managers. I wanted to capture this here to spread this to a larger
group and for future reference.

I grouped them into three groups for you, (1) You share your details and
provide updates (2) Ask for details that need (3) Work collaboratively to
layout the future plan.

üì§ Update  
1Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs been going well for you?  
2Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs not going well for you?  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Provide feedback

üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ask  
1Ô∏è‚É£ What are the team priorities?  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Ask for opportunities  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Ask for feedback  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Ask for resources

ü§ù Collaborate  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Career planning  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Brainstorm
