title: Defining a Test Approach for Accessibility
---

Just like any other testing, you would need to plan well ahead of time for
accessibility testing. You must identify the project objectives, define what
needs to be tested to achieve them, and most importantly how to test. Having
an effective test strategy and documented approach will help layout the
roadmap for testing and produce a quality product with reduced risks. There's
a lot of aspects to be considered for Accessibility, some of them are listed
below.

  * Application Type
  * Customers or Users of the application
  * Regulation, Legislation, and Laws of the land
  * Aspects of Accessibility to cover
  * Compatibility (Cross-platform, devices, and browsers)
  * WCAG Guidelines / Levels
  * Testing Tools
  * Defects Management (Reporting, Resolution & Retesting)
  * Assumptions, Risks, and Constraints
